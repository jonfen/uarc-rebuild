Note: Beacon listings are for information only. The Utah VHF Society does not coordinate simplex or beacon activity.

## Explanation of the abbreviations used in the Info column:

O - Designates "open" repeater or system, available for all to use.  Note that an "open" system may include a "closed" (e.g. members only) autopatch.

C - Designates "closed" repeater or system.  For more information about the "how and why" of closed systems, look at the Frequency Coordination FAQ.

X - Designates a "Wide Area Coverage" repeater.  Typically, this repeater offers unusually wide coverage, usually due to its excellent location.

A - Designates that this repeater has an autopatch. Note: Most autopatches are closed except to members of the supporting organization, even if the repeater itself is open. NOTE:  Where it is uncertain whether or not the autopatch is closed, it will be listed with an "A" and not a "Ca".  For more info about "closed" patches, look here.

Ca - Designates an autopatch that is known to be "closed" (see above).

Rb - Designates "Remote Base" capability.  This usually means that there is another radio on-site that can be remotely "steered" to other frequencies, linking them to the repeater.

Snp - Shared — no protection. Designates a frequency that can be used for temporary and experimental repeaters. No protection is guaranteed from similar repeaters that may commence operation.

I - Internet. Designates a repeater that can be linked to other repeaters, users, and systems using “Voice Over Internet Protocol” (VOIP). This includes repeaters participating in systems such as IRLP, EchoLink, E-QSO, WIRES, etc. When available, additional information about such repeaters is carried in the “Links” column in italics.

P - Portable. Designates a repeater which may be operated from different locations as required for emergencies and special events.
