Status of the remote: UP

The Utah Amateur Radio Club operates a remotely-controlled HF transceiver at a site in grid square DM39 near Leamington, Utah, in Juab County between Nephi and Delta. UARC members can use this remote to operate on many HF bands.

The UARC HF Remote utilizes the software framework from the web site http://remotehams.com . You must register using your call sign, not any other nickname, then read the following rules: Guidelines for use of the UARC remote HF radio

Given understanding and acceptance of the rules, please request access permission from the HF Remote Manager (which is the current UARC President, Morris Farmer, AD7SR) by sending e-mail to Morris at ad7sr@comcast.net.

There are some registration and software setup instructions at the RemoteHams site, but first please read the following manual in PDF format which was written specifically for the UARC HF Remote: UARC HF Remote Station Manual

Also available is this Quick Reference Guide to the UARC HF Remote: Quick Reference Guide

Principal Engineer for the UARC HF Remote at Leamington is Gary, KK7DV, who can be reached by e-mail to kk7dv@arrl.net. Gary can help work any technical issues and answer any questions about this system.
