Our UARC President will be presenting the next UARC meeting on Thursday, Novermber 12. He writes:

“Every Ham proudly remembers the day he passed the exam for his General ticket. Then he stops and realizes that the high frequency bands are all new territory and his station will need an upgrade to work these new bands. As a Technician you probably used off-the-shelf equipment and just did the plug-and-play routine. That doesn’t generally work when assembling an HF station.

“Building your very own HF station can be one of the most challenging and enjoyable experiences of your Ham career. It is important that you are armed with the information needed to do it right the first time, thus avoiding the frustrations and expenses of having to go back and fix what you did wrong.

“I'm going to discuss a fairly comprehensive list of what you're going to be needing to get on HF with the goal of taking some of the mystery of what’s needed and why. Fair warning: the list is long. In fact, I'm a bit concerned about scaring you away.

“While you really will need these items that I'm going to talk about, most of them aren't terribly expensive and will last for years, probably your whole time as a ham. The most expensive and shortest lived will likely be your radio and that can easily last 15-20 years.

“Hopefully I will help you get most of it right the first time.”
