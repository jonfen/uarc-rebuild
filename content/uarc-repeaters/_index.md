The Utah Amateur Radio Club (UARC) supports four repeaters along the Wasatch Front:  The 146.76 repeater on Lake Mountain (west of Provo, Utah), the 146.62 and the 449.10, both on Farnsworth Peak, and 146.62 on Scott's Hill above Brighton.

## The 146.62 linked repeater system:
There is are two 146.62 repeaters - one on Farnsworth Peak, west of the Salt Lake Valley and another on Scott's Hill, near Brighton, in the mountains east of Salt Lake.  These repeaters operate together, on the same frequency, as a single, wide-area repeater using voting receivers and synchronous (simulcasting) transmitters.
146.620 - Farnsworth Peak:  The hub of the 146.620 repeater system is located on Farnsworth Peak, 18 miles southwest of downtown Salt Lake City. This repeater system is used as a general-purpose ragchew repeater and the Farnsworth site covers as far south as Nephi, as far north as Malad, Idaho, and as far west as Wendover, using a 1/4 wave antenna and 50 watts, mobile.  This repeater is linked full-time to another 146.620 repeater atop Scott's Hill - see below.
146.620 - Scott's Hill:  This repeater operates in conjunction with the 146.620 repeater on Farnsworth from Scott's Hill, a site above Brighton - at the top of Big Cottonwood Canyon - near Guardsman Pass.  This repeater augments coverage of Farnsworth peak, extending coverage into the Park City and Heber areas as well as providing coverage into southwest Wyoming.
The 146.620 Synchronous/Voting repeater system:  This page provides a few more details about how you can get away with having two repeaters that are fairly near each other that are operating on the same frequency. 
Coverage of the 146.620 Synchronous/Voting repeater system:  This page has maps showing the expected coverage of the system as a whole, and which repeater can be expected to cover where.

## Other repeaters:
146.760 - Lake Mountain:  The oldest of these repeaters is the 146.760 repeater on Lake Mountain west of Orem, Utah primarily providing coverage in Utah and Salt Lake counties, although it s coverage does extend beyond this.  This repeater is also IRLP node #3352 and Echolink node #703269 - for more information, see the UARC IRLP/Echolink page.
449.100 - Farnsworth Peak:  Also located on Farnsworth Peak, and it operates on 449.100 MHz. This repeater also sports an autopatch covering the Salt Lake City area.  This repeater, unlike the '62 and '76, is actually owned and operated by Glen Worthington, WA7X with some support from UARC (i.e. use of the repeater site, etc.)  Specific questions about this repeater should be directed toward Glen.  Note that this repeater is currently offline, but is expected to return to the air in the future.

There is also the Repeater Status page:  This page shows the current state of UARCs repeaters, as well as notes on previous repeater-related activities.

## Learning about repeaters:
A lot of people think that the way to learn about repeaters is to visit the repeater site.

While there is certainly a lot that can be learned there, many people may not learn very much if they don't already know the prerequisites:  How transmitters and receivers work. The transmitters and receivers that repeaters use are fundamentally the same as the ones that we use from our homes and automobiles.

So the first step is really to understand your own radio:  Know what the block diagram of a superheterodyne receiver looks like. Know what a mixer is.  Know what an oscillator circuit or a multiplier circuit looks like.  (Almost all of this can be found in ARRL's "The Radio Amateur's Handbook".)

Once you know the fundamentals, then you can easily pick up information about the handful of things that are unique to repeaters such as cavity filters, desensitization, site noise floors, and transmitter noise spectra.  After all, it'll all make more sense if 'ya know what you're lookin' at!


## UARC DF (Direction Finding) Page

Have you ever want to get involved in the transmitter hunts held by various groups?  Or, maybe figure out who it is that unknowingly sat on their microphone? Maybe you wanted to find out who the person making unidentified, obscene transmissions on the repeater?  Then you need to equip yourself some direction-finding equipment..

Direction-finding is surprisingly easy and inexpensive to get started in: You can use a use the HT/antenna that you probably already have, or you could enhance it with a simple yagi and a simple attenuator - or even build one of the simple homing circuits with a single integrated circuit or even, with a bit of skill, you can build your own DF unit for a few tens of dollars if you can use a soldering iron and read a schematic. (And you learned that when studying for your test, right?)

Clint, KA7OEI, has put together some information to help you get started. Check the UARC DFing Page for some basic pointers and the famed circuits designed by Mike Mladejovsky, WA7ARK. Mike has been involved with CAP in locating downed aircraft. His team has won a national contest and located their target a good hour before the nearest competition.  Mike's circuits have been circulating in the Utah ham community (and abroad!) for a number of years and are now available here on the web.

Even if you don't know how to build an electronic circuit, get together with someone who can and work together on it.  It's fun - and you never know:  You might enjoy it and learn something!
